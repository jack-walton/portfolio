## Output Format

### What's New
[New features customers can use]

### Improvements
[Enhancements to existing functionality]

### Fixed
[Bugs and issues that have been resolved]

## Guidelines

- Write from the customer's perspective — focus on what changed for them, not internal implementation details
- Use plain language; avoid engineering jargon
- Present tense, active voice
- No em-dashes
- Omit changes that are purely internal (refactors, test updates, CI changes) unless they affect customer behavior
- Each item should be one sentence
